\question[12] What values of $a$ make
$\mathbold{v}=2a\mathbold{i}-a\mathbold{j}+16\mathbold{k}$
orthogonal to $5\mathbold{i}+a\mathbold{j}-\mathbold{k}$?

\question[20]
Let $P=\left(0,1,0\right)$, $Q=\left(-1,1,2\right)$,
and $R=\left(2,1,-1\right)$ and let $\Pi$ be the plane
containing $P,Q,R$.
\begin{parts}
\part Find the measure of $\angle PQR$.
\part Find the area of $\Delta PQR$.
\part Find the projection of $\overrightarrow{PQ}$
onto $\overrightarrow{PR}$.
\part Find a vector perpendicular to $\Pi$.
\item Find an equation for $\Pi$.
\item Find the distance from $\Pi$ to the origin.
\end{parts}

\question[20] One force is pushing an object in a direction
$50^\circ$ south of east with a force of 25~newtons.
A second force is simultaneously pushing the object
in a direction $70^\circ$ north of west with a force of
60~newtons. If the object is to remain stationary,
give the direction and magnitude of the third force that must
be applied to the object to counterbalance
the first two.
